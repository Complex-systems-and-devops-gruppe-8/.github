### Summary
This project involves the development of a comprehensive gambling website featuring games like poker, roulette, and coinflip. The frontend is built using React, TypeScript, and Vite, ensuring a responsive and engaging user experience. The backend leverages Quarkus with Java and PostgreSQL to handle game logic, user authentication, and secure data management. Maven is used for project management and build automation, streamlining the development process.

A key focus of the project is the integration of DevOps practices, utilizing Docker for containerization and GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment. This approach facilitates frequent updates and efficient scaling, ensuring the platform remains robust and adaptable to user needs. The project emphasizes security through custom token-based authentication and follows a modular architecture to enhance maintainability and scalability. Comprehensive testing strategies are in place to ensure the quality and stability of the application across all components.

### Future Work
#### Frontend Development
Future enhancements will focus on applying advanced React patterns and hooks to improve state management and code reliability. The integration of centralized state management solutions will be explored to handle larger applications more efficiently.

#### Backend Security and Authentication
The project will continue to refine its custom token-based authentication system, ensuring robust security measures are in place. This includes setting up HTTPS certificates and configuring SSL/TLS for secure connections, as well as implementing rate limiting and input validation to prevent common web attacks.

#### System Architecture and Development 
Although the current architecture is based on a single service, future work will explore ways to optimize scalability and maintainability. This includes refining the existing service architecture and exploring efficient communication methods within the system.

#### Package Management
The project will focus on optimizing dependency management using Maven and npm, ensuring efficient handling of libraries and tools. Proper version control and semantic versioning strategies will be implemented to maintain consistency and reliability.

#### CI/CD Pipeline Enhancement
Enhancements to the CI/CD pipeline will include implementing automated testing at all levels and setting up continuous deployment pipelines for faster releases. Integrating static code analysis tools will further improve code quality and maintainability.

#### Containerization and Cloud Services 
The project will optimize Docker images for smaller sizes and faster build times, ensuring efficient deployment processes. While Kubernetes and serverless architectures are not currently in use, future exploration of these technologies may provide additional benefits.

#### Full-stack Application Development 
Continued development will focus on integrating frontend and backend components seamlessly, with an emphasis on real-time features using WebSockets or Server-Sent Events. The project aims to develop a robust API gateway for managing and securing application interactions.

***
**By focusing on these areas, the project will align closely with the course objectives, enhancing both the technical capabilities of the application and the skills of the development team.**

### Short description of project management
Our project management setup utilizes a GitHub organization named ["Complex-systems-and-devops-gruppe-8"](https://github.com/Complex-systems-and-devops-gruppe-8) to facilitate collaboration and resource allocation. Within this organization, we maintain three repositories: `.github`, `frontend`, and `backend`. The `.github` repository is used for managing the organization's profile and reports. The `frontend` and `backend` repositories house the respective codebases for client-side and server-side components. This structure enables efficient development practices and ensures all team members have access to necessary resources for seamless project execution.

We leverage GitHub Actions to automate our CI/CD pipelines, enhancing our development workflow by automating testing, building, and deployment processes directly within our GitHub repositories.

Project management in software development involves coordinating planning, execution, and delivery of projects to achieve specific goals efficiently. It encompasses using various tools and methodologies to manage resources, timelines, and risks effectively. Our setup applies selected frameworks for frontend and backend development, implements state management, sets up backend security, uses package managers, establishes CI/CD pipelines, and utilizes containerization for deployment. These practices guide the design and implementation of a full-stack application, integrating all elements to deliver a cohesive and functional product.
