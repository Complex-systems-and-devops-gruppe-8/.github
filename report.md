### Frontend Development

The frontend of the project is developed using **React**, which is a JavaScript library used for building user interfaces. React uses a component-based architecture, which facilitates breaking down the UI into small reusable components. All these components have their own logic and rendering characteristics, which is useful for keeping a codebase clean and maintainable.

#### Routing

In the frontend, we utilize **React Router** for the routing of the application. This allows the user to navigate between different pages without doing a full page reload. This is done by wrapping a `Router` tag around different `Route` tags and specifying what component should be rendered if the user navigates to said routes.

```react
<Router>
  <Routes>
    <Route path="/" element={<LandingPage />} />
    <Route path="/coinflip" element={<CoinFlipPage />} />
    <Route path="/poker" element={<PokerPage />} />
    <Route path="/blackjack" element={<BlackjackPage />} />
  </Routes>
</Router>

```

#### Component Structure

Our component structure so far is such that each page in the application is built as a separate component. This means that we have four different page components:

- **LandingPage**: The first page of the application that the user will see.
- **PokerPage**: A page for the poker game.
- **CoinflipPage**: A page for the coin flip game.
- **BlackjackPage**: A page for the blackjack game.

These components are just empty at this point, but functionality will be developed further as the project progresses.

#### TypeScript Integration

The frontend is also built using **TypeScript**, which enables typing. This is useful to help catch errors during development rather than at runtime. TypeScript is best used by defining **interfaces** and **types** for componentsâ€™ props and states. This ensures that data passed between components is structured correctly.

[EXAMPLES]

#### Styling with Tailwind CSS

For the styling of the front end, **Tailwind CSS** is used. Tailwind CSS is one of many CSS frameworks that makes it easier to style different components. One of the advantages of Tailwind is that it has built-in responsiveness, making it simple to create a layout that adapts to different screen sizes.

#### Build Tool: Vite

As for building the application, we use **Vite**. Vite is a build tool that focuses on the developer experience by enabling hot-reloading, which improves the experience for developers when working on the application.
