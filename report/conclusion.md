#### Lessons Learned
During the project we have learned alot about DevOps practices and collaboration. One of the biggest things we have learned is how to use pull requests  efficiently in order to review and collaborate on source code. We've also learned how to use GitHub and GitHub Actions to set up build and testing pipelines that ensure the solution being pushed is able to run and pass the tests that we have written to the project, thus applying the best practices of CI/CD development. We have also learned how to set up a full stack application using two different repositories that work together when ran simultaneously. Other than that we have learned how to implement and use token based security in order to add authorization layers to our solutions in order to protect endpoints.
