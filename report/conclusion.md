### 7. Conclusion

#### Project Outcomes

#### Future Improvements

Future improvements should include the addition of more games and extensive frontend testing, including endpoint testing. The DevOps workflow should be maintained, integrating development and operations seamlessly. This approach ensures continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), allowing for rapid deployment of new features and quick resolution of issues. By fostering collaboration between development and operations teams, we can achieve higher efficiency, reliability, and scalability in our software development process. In summary, we have established a solid foundation for continuing this workflow with our existing development environment - however our code infrastructure could use some work. 

#### Lessons Learned
During the project we have learned alot about DevOps practices and collaboration. One of the biggest things we have learned is how to use pull requests  efficiently in order to review and collaborate on source code. We've also learned how to use GitHub and GitHub Actions to set up build and testing pipelines that ensure the solution being pushed is able to run and pass the tests that we have written to the project, thus applying the best practices of CI/CD development. We have also learned how to set up a full stack application using two different repositories that work together when ran simultaneously. Other than that we have learned how to implement and use token based security in order to add authorization layers to our solutions in order to protect endpoints.
