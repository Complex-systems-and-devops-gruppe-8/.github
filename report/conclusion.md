#### Project Outcomes

#### Future Improvements

Future improvements should include the addition of more games and extensive frontend testing, including endpoint testing. The DevOps workflow should be maintained, integrating development and operations seamlessly. This approach ensures continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), allowing for rapid deployment of new features and quick resolution of issues. By fostering collaboration between development and operations teams, we can achieve higher efficiency, reliability, and scalability in our software development process. In summary, we have established a solid foundation for continuing this workflow with our existing development environment - however our code infrastructure could use some work.
